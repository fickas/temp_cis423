"SMITH, Captain Edward John",62.0,Male,Crew,Southampton,1.0,0.0,"        captain edward john smith was born at hanley, stoke-on-trent on 27 january 1850, the son of potter edward smith and catherine smith. his parents later owned a shop1.  edward attended the etruria british school until the age of 13 when he went to liverpool to begin a seafaring career. he apprenticed with gibson & co., liverpool and joined the white star line in 1880 gaining his first command in 1887. among the ships he would command were the first republic, the coptic, majestic, baltic, adriatic and olympic.  smith served with distinction in the boer war by commanding troopships to the cape.  as he rose in seniority smith gained a reputation amongst passengers and crew for quiet flamboyance. some passengers would only sail the atlantic in a ship commanded by him. after he became commodore of the white star fleet in 1904, it became routine for smith to command the line's newest ships on their maiden voyages. it was, therefore, no surprise that smith took the titanic on her maiden voyage in april 1912. this responsibility was rewarded with a salary of £1,250 per year and a no-collision bonus of $200. because of his position as a commander in the royal naval reserve smith had the distinction of being able to fly the blue duster of the r.n.r., most ships flew the red duster of the merchant marine.  smith was married to eleanor and they had a young daughter helen melville. the family lived in an imposing red brick, twin-gabled house ""woodhead"" on winn road, portswood, southampton.    on april 10, 1912, edward john smith, wearing a bowler hat and a long overcoat, took a taxi from his home to southampton docks. he came aboard the titanic at 7.00 am to prepare for the board of trade muster at 8.00 am. he immediately went to his cabin to get the sailing report from chief officer henry wilde.   	 		 			 			 your browser does not support the video tag. 			 			 			 your browser does not support the video tag. 			 		 		 			captain smith is filmed standing by the starboard entrance to the bridge.  			and poses self-consciously on the starboard wing bridge. 		 	   captain smith filmed on the deck of the rms olympic, after her maiden arrival in new york, summer 1911.     after departure at 12:00, the wash from the propeller caused the laid-up new york to break from her moorings and swing towards the titanic. quick action from smith helped to avert a premature end to the maiden voyage. the unfortunate incident was seen by some as an ill omen and it was reminiscent of the hawke incident in 1911 when that vessel collided with the olympic which was under the command of captain smith.  during the voyage, smith normally took meals at a small table in the dining saloon or in his cabin, attended by his personal valet, or ""tiger"", arthur paintin. on the night of april 14, however, he attended a dinner party held in his honour by george widener and his family. the party was attended by the cream of 1912 society as it was represented on the titanic. however, smith was possibly concerned that the ship was entering the ice zone about which he had received ample warnings during the weekend. he excused himself early and went to the bridge.  charles lightoller was keeping watch and discussed the temperature with smith for a while. smith told lightoller to alert him immediately if he was at all concerned. he then retired to bed.  about 11.40 p.m.  captain smith was awakened by the collision and rushed to the bridge. he received the report of the accident from first officer william murdoch and then made a quick inspection of the ship with thomas andrews. he immediately ordered the boats prepared but wavered when it came to giving the order to load and lower them lightoller had to approach him for the order which he eventually gave.  surprisingly little is known about smith's actions in the last two hours of the ships life. his legendary skills of leadership seem to have deserted him, he was curiously indecisive and unusually cautious.

the water was just coming in slightly. i told the other fellows to get up, that there was something wrong and, that the water was coming in. they only laughed at me. one of them says: ""get back into bed. you are not in ireland now.""   he hurriedly dressed and his three bunkmates eventually got out of bed; with it being a small cabin, buckley left to give them room to dress themselves whilst he waited outside. two crewmen passed by shouting ""all up on deck unless you want to get drowned!"" and buckley immediately hastened to the upper decks and never saw his friends again.   arriving in communal areas buckley noticed other passengers wearing lifejackets but he had none so made his way back down to his cabin to retrieve it; he was stopped in his tracks as the water in the area was coming level with the third or fourth step of the staircase.   at one point buckley was gathered with some other steerage men when one attempted to ascend a small flight of stairs into a first class area of the ship; a crewman came along and pushed the man back and snapped the gate shut and locked it. the same steerage passenger angrily chased after the man and broke the lock on the gate; he could not find the offending crewman and said if he had he would have chucked him into the ocean.  buckley began to look elsewhere for a lifejacket and soon encountered a first class passenger who had two; the man surrendered one to him and helped him to fasten it on. he made his way to the boat deck where he stated that he assisted in helping lower five lifeboats. he was standing at boat 13 when a crowd of male passengers and crew jumped into the boat; buckley made a split-second decision to join them and leapt in himself. two officers came along with a crowd of steerage passengers and ordered the men out, most complied, leaving only he and five other men, firemen and sailors—he broke down and began to cry at the thought of his fate but a compassionate woman in the boat threw her shawl over his head and told him to hold fast. he mistakenly believed the woman to be mrs astor. the disguise worked and the boat was lowered to the water. his friend bridget bradley was in the same boat and buckley recalled her being very nervous and excitable, attempting to climb one of the falls when she thought the lifeboat was sinking, only to be subdued by a crewman.  as the night wore on those in the lifeboat spied the lights of carpathia; such a welcome sight caused many to become hysterical and jump around; the crew attempted to control them and have them sit back down but many remained standing.   daniel was later called upon to testify at the american inquiry into the sinking, one of the few third-class passengers to do so.  it is not certain if daniel ever returned to ireland and he was later joined in america by his sister catherine. he lived at 284 east 137th street in bronx, new york.    the europe buckley left behind erupted into war and when the usa became involved he voluntarily enlisted into the 69th new york infantry (later the 165th regiment) as a private on 1 june 1917. he served in france from the end of october 1917 and was promoted to 1st class private on 1 september 1918. of the various campaigns he was involved with, one of the most noteworthy was the rouge bouquet campaign; on 7 march 1918 german artillery bombarded american trenches and the 165th regiment suffered heavy losses; daniel was one of the few survivors from that regiment. only a few weeks later, on 21 march 1918 he was ""slightly wounded"".

the gunwales were scarcely 6"" above the waterline and the damage that the boat had acquired during lowering had produced a leak. dymond took the tiller, sometimes being relieved by fireman harry noss, and in the cramped in and cold conditions he started to suffer from the cold, wearing nothing but a flannel sweater and dungarees. a spare sweater he had brought with him was given to trimmer walter fredericks to help keep him warm.  after a while dymond reported hearing an explosion and seeing the ship split and the stern settle back. another explosion occurred which he attributed to the aft boilers bursting and the stern then rose into the air and the lights went out, followed by the horrific noise of everything loose in the ship crashing, mingled with that of the shrieks and cries of those still aboard. the stern section then plunged.  one ""dago"" man in the lifeboat became hysterical and dymond confessed that if he had been able to reach him he would have struck him with the boat's tiller as he was upsetting the other occupants. to try and make themselves visible the boat's occupants burned shirts, handkerchiefs and rags on a boathook.  frank was not required to testify at either the us or british inquiries into the sinking.

"NEWELL, Mr Arthur Webster",58.0,Male,C1,Cherbourg,0.0,113.0,"        mr arthur webster newell, 58, was born in chelsea, massachusetts, on january 30, 1854, the only child of benjamin and susan (bennett) newell. he was educated in chelsea's public schools. at an early age, he began to support himself. a brilliant student, eager to learn, he began working as a clerk in a boston bank. he later became a bookkeeper in the fourth national bank of boston. with the growth of business in its neighborhood, and particularly with the development of the great markets and provision houses on which the bank relied, it quickly grew in size and importance. arthur newell knew his business well. he was quick, accurate and reliable.  on october 11, 1877, arthur newell married his childhood sweetheart, mary greeley, also from chelsea, massachusetts.  in 1879, newell was appointed the bank's chief cashier. after his promotion, a daughter named madeleine was born on october 10, 1880, followed two years later by a second daughter, named alice, in 1882.  as his position in the bank advanced, mr newell's success permitted his family to move from chelsea to lexington, massachusetts, in 1888. here he bought a large home which was landscaped into an attractive gentleman's farm. mr newell became an earnest and devoted citizen of the town. aside from his business, his strongest lay in the hancock congregational church. he was ardent supporter and an upright, influential member whose convictions were deep and whose religious temperament and devotion were unmistakable.  on february 12, 1889, a third daughter was born to mr and mrs newell whom they named marjorie.  although a respected and successful businessma, mr newell attended strictly to his own business, and preferred the direct approach to any diplomacy. he had a singularly high regard for truth. flattery never left his lips and praise from him was a simple statement of fact - an act of judgment. his daughter marjorie later said that her father's inner clarity of spirit made him a keen judge of honesty and reliability in others. it was said that honest people had nothing to fear from him but the double-dealer might well avoid him.  to those who knew mr newell well, he was in outward demeanor what the world called ""cold."" his character appeared distant and austere in social circles. his companions were many, but few were close. neighbors respected him but his association with them was infrequent. as far as she could think, marjorie remembered that even her mother addressed her husband, at least in public, as ""mr newell.""  yet, mr newell was an exceedingly sensitive man who knew how highly charged words between people could be in causing pleasure and pain. to those who knew him well, he was among the most affectionate of men with a tenderness unsuspected by those who saw only the surface. despite an almost puritan character, he envinced love and warmth often.  marjorie remembered an occasion when she was a young girl of about 7 or 8. one summer, she and a neighbor boy were playing in the barn next to the newell home. the ladder leading to the loft seemed daring and together they climbed the rungs when they heard the groom approaching the barn door. the children hid among the hay bales, secretly watching from above. unknown to them, mr newell had asked one of his farm hands to kill a turkey for dinner. just as the hatchet was raised, piercing screams filled the barn. mr newell raced in where the farm hand had frozen in his tracks. the children were crying uncontrollably and quietly mr newell brought them down. before the children, he ordered that the turkey be spared (at least for the time being), and spent the entire afternoon comforting and playing with them.  another occasion occurred when madeleine, alice and marjorie were eating dinner at the dining room table. for an unknown reasons, the girls were giggling among themselves, annoying mr newell. without saying a word, he took his knife and tapped his water glass three times with a look of disapproval. this signified a quick end to the giggling. after dessert, however, mr newell perhaps concerned about his stern technique, took each daughter on one of their long walks through the countryside, often quoting from the bible and telling enchanting stories. marjorie was especially delighted. ""we were so honored to be able to go on a walk with father. he seemed so busy most of the time and we loved and respected him because of all the attention he gave us despite that. what child would feel that way about their father today?"" marjorie wondered years later.  in 1896, the newells moved to a more modern estate at 20 percy road in lexington, massachusetts. a year later, mr newell was elected chairman of the fourth national bank, now thriving in the heart of boston thanks to his oversight, wisdom and personal direction.  as the family grew, they became very close. mr newell had musical talent, and all of his daughters were taught violin by some of the best music instructors in boston. mr newell played the cello and mrs newell the piano. every sunday afternoon, the family congregated in the living room. the newell's home's choice music was a source of unfailing delight, and in history books written about lexington, the newell home was described as the site of many wonderful family musical entertainments.  as his daughters grew up, madeleine and alice went on to attend smith college in northampton, massachusetts. the elder girls were serious students while young marjorie was not. she chose to turn down the opportunity to attend smith college and freely admitted that she was not a serious student in areas that did not interest her. music and violin were her favorite recreations.  in march 1909, mr newell arranged for his family's first trip abroad to europe. none were more pleased than marjorie, who travelled with her father into boston to buy a scrapbook in which to record their journeys. the newells sailed in april aboard the white star liner romanic. they would spend more than three months visiting italy, switzerland, germany, france and england. on their return voyage home, marjorie entered the final words in her scrapbook, ""we had only our memories left of the past three months. but what were those memories - pleasant ones? yes, delightful. we have concluded that european travel is a wonderful experience and education, but like everything else in the world, everything is not perfection. but why look for unpleasantness when you leave home seeking pleasure?"" hauntingly, marjorie's next trip would end in circumstances she clearly asked herself about.  in 1912, mr newell decided to take his family overseas again. his particular area of interest was now the middle east. as a student of the bible, he very much wanted to see egypt, israel (then known as the holy land) and the surrounding areas. however, for this journey, mrs newell and daughter alice would not be joining the family. the trip to europe in 1909 had taken its toll on them. they were delicate ladies and did not feel that they had the energy or strength to make another long journey. instead, mr newell travelled with madeleine and marjorie to the lands mr newell had always wished to see.  the trio spent about three months seeing such places at cairo, bethlehem and jerusalem. marjorie remembered how impressed her father was to have seen these holy places and spoke about them constantly.  the newells left the middle east and sailed for marseilles, france in april, 1912. they eventually arrived in paris where madeleine and marjorie learned of a surprise their father had made for them. to finish such a pleasurable trip to the middle east, mr newell had made reservations for the three of them to return home to the united states aboard the maiden voyage of the rms titanic, the largest ocean liner in the world.  the newells embarked on the titanic in cherbourg, france. mr newell was assigned cabin d-48, while his daughters shared stateroom d-36. among the items they had brought with them were two violins. mr newell had reminded his girls to bring them with them so they could practice while they were touring. marjorie remembered that every evening she and her sister madeleine would play the violin in their cabins for about an hour before they went to bed.  marjorie remembered the last afternoon she would spend with her father on the titanic. she remembered sitting in deck chairs with her father and sister and talked with them about the ancient sites they had seen. she remembered looking at her father to see how pleased he was at having visited the middle east. it was as if he had finally managed to accomplish the one thing in life he had not yet done. she was very proud of him.  at dinner that last evening, marjorie remembered seeing all of the beautiful gowns being worn by the ladies as they entered the dining room for dinner. ""i had been given my first long train gown before i left home, and i took great pleasure in wearing it that night,"" marjorie said. after dinner while sitting in the titanic's reception room, mr newell pointed out mr and mrs john jacob astor to his two daughters. mr newell then turned to his daughters and asked, ""do you think you will be able to last until morning?"" he was joking with them concerning their healthy appetites. a woman who was sitting next to marjorie turned to her and said, ""don't you think the ship is going too fast? we are in the icebergs and i think we should slow down."" marjorie was unaware of the situation.  mr newell and his daughters retired at 10:30 p.m. on april 14th. about an hour and half later, marjorie remembered being awakened by the collision with the iceberg. before they could get dressed and investigate, there was a knock at their cabin door. it was mr newell. his only words were, ""get up, girls and get dressed. put on your warmest clothes and follow me.""  the sisters joined their father in the hall, and joined the other passengers heading up to the boat deck. marjorie remembered that her father was very quiet but made all possible investigations into what was going to be done. marjorie learned later that the ship had struck an iceberg and could distinctly feel the slight list the titanic was making.  when they reached the boat deck, marjorie saw one lifeboat being lowered. arthur newell turned to his daughters and told them that they would have to get into a lifeboat and row around until the damage to the titanic was repaired. he led them to lifeboat number 6 and placed them in. his last words to marjorie were, ""it does seem more dangerous for you to get into that boat than to remain here with me here but we must obey orders."" marjorie last saw her father standing back helping other women in the boat.  in her later years, marjorie thought back to that cold april night. ""i often wonder what father did after he said goodbye to us. i would like to think that he went to help other women and children. he would have never taken a place knowing there were others still aboard. i am sure he thought about my mother and sister and perhaps wished he had never taken us on this trip.""

augustus is no longer listed in the philadelphia city directory after 1888. he apparently started working for the white star line around 1892 as a barber, and may have been working earlier for another shipping line. by 1897 the weikman family had moved to palmyra, burlington county, new jersey. in july of that year, “augustus weikman arrived home from an ocean voyage on wednesday afternoon.” in

sired by nippers wee boy, offering them for sale cheap in february 1912 from their home in palmyra.  augustus signed on to be the titanic’s barber on 4 april 1912, his previous ship the olympic. he gave his address as at mrs. daysh’s home at ivy bank, dyer road in southampton. he thought he had made more than 700 trips (in some accounts he said 705, in others 750) back and forth across the atlantic by the time he set sail. weikman sent his wife a telegram telling her his good luck at being assigned to the titanic. he was reportedly the only american crew member. he received a shilling a week and depended on tips from the first-class passengers to make his living. the barber' shop was located near the first-class entrance foyer, had two adjustable chairs, a waiting area, and also sold souvenirs to passengers. his brother william was working as a barber aboard the cedric.  when the ship struck the iceberg he was in his barber's shop reading and felt a slight jar, but it did not seem serious.  “i went forward to the steerage on ‘g’ deck and saw one of the baggage-masters [edward bessant], and he told me that water was coming in in the baggage room on the deck below."" weikman hurried up a stairway toward the deck and passed thomas andrews who told him, “my god, it’s serious,” when he asked him whether the ship was in danger. captain smith also passed by but did not answer weikman’s question.   he then proceeded along e deck to his room on c deck and then up to the main deck where he saw some ice laying about.  steward george dodd was giving the order to man the lifeboats. weikman began to help, noting that he was putting in three or four women for every man. there was a shortage of women for the first boats.  he did not board one of the boats “the lifeboats offered no opportunity for the savings of a humble barber.” he worked alongside bruce ismay, who was wearing his pyjamas and was barefoot. after launching several lifeboats “he came to the conclusion that it was not necessary to spoil his new uniform so he returned to his room and put on an old suit and supplied himself with a pair of gloves.” he returned on deck and as the last boat was being launched, saw ismay and mr. carter climb in collapsible c “there were no women in the vicinity of the boat.”  augustus then began to help to get loose one of the two remaining collapsible lifeboats, almost certainly collapsible a, the men attempting to pull up the sides. he claimed that john jacob astor and george widener were standing nearby. suddenly the bow dipped under. he and many others were “hurled into a jumble in the centre of the boat. i was covered with ropes, timbers, and chains [probably chairs] and while endeavouring to extricate myself could hear the shrieks, yells and moans of the dying. finally, i got loose except for a rope fastened around my foot. this gave me considerable trouble, but i finally got free and began to swim away from the ship.” he got about 15 feet away and the second of two explosions occurred and he thought he was thrown about 100 feet away. nearby in the frigid water was a cluster of about one dozen deck chairs tied together and he climbed aboard. he looked back at the titanic and saw the stern portion of the ship standing on end and slowly sinking downwards.  after the ship went under, with no noticeable suction, he scanned the area and saw a lifeboat about 600 feet away. the chair raft was not large enough and left his legs and feet in the water. he realized the lifeboat offered a better chance for survival and paddled himself over to the boat, which he found contained very few people. some of the men who clutched the side of the collapsible were already dead from exposure. he clambered aboard and stood in the water-filled boat. he thought that about 17 of the 28 people on the lifeboat were still alive when the carpathia arrived and that he was nearly “all in.”  he was taken aboard the carpathia, only partly conscious, and awoke in the steerage dining room, surrounded by people who didn’t speak english. “and it was found that his feet had been frozen and he is still in danger of being maimed for life.” he was still wearing a vest and when he explored its pockets he found a one-dollar bill. ‘that he determined to keep as a souvenir of the terrible experience he had endured.” he also had a gold pocket watch that had stopped at 1:50.  weikman’s name was not on the initial lists of survivors and it was not until wednesday, april 17, that the family received a telegram. it was reported after the disaster that:  one of the survivors of the titanic disaster is augustus h. weikman, ship’s barber. he is a resident of palmyra, near mount holly, n.j., and is one of the largest property owners of the town. relatives and neighbors were condoling with mrs. weikman yesterday when a message was received from her husband by way of halifax that he was safe. weikman has been a barber for 20 years on the white star line and when the titanic was put on line he was given the post of ship’s barber by reason of his seniority of service.  weikman was interviewed by the trenton evening times upon his arrival in new york city.  “weikman showed the effects of the terrible experiences through which he had just passed, and at time his talk was almost incoherent. he was unable to leave the chair and was wheeled from the waiting room to the train that leaves the terminal at 1 o’clock.” he would later state that he thought the lifeboats that had been launched could have returned and picked up more passengers. aboard the train heading to camden, new jersey, he told of his adventure to interested travelers. when he arrived at the train station, a push cart was used to take him home since he could not walk.  weikman prepared an affidavit in may 1912 in which he claimed that “j. bruce ismay was justified in leaving the titanic when he did because there were no more women in the vicinity ‘when he was ordered into the boat by the officer in charge.” he was honored a few days later by being made an honorary member of washington camp, no. 23 p.o.s. of a.  he was walking with crutches when he attended the event. he gave another talk at the camden lodge of elks in which he told of his experiences and blamed the accident on the wireless company.  in july 1912, he heard that mrs. john hays hammond was raising money for a titanic memorial and he wrote her a letter in which he told of his experiences. he sent along the dollar bill from his vest pocket.  augustus was offered the position of “admiral’s barber” on the olympic in august 1912 and expected to return to work after he had recovered from his injuries. he ended up sailing aboard the lusitania instead. he registered as an american citizen in southampton on 6 november 1914, using his seaman’s discharge book as evidence of his citizenship. he resigned as barber, perhaps in early 1915, after german submarines started to target ships in the atlantic ocean. by 1917, augustus was living at 109 broad street in palymra. his son augustus, jr. was living with while working as a farmer.  on 15 january 1920, augustus and mary and their children helen and harry lived at 109 broad street in palmyra. they owned their home.  he worked as a merchant while daughter helen was a milliner and son harry was a laborer at a watch case company.

but now feel dead tired & more fit for bed than anything. have to go to dinner-tea in half an hour, percy. 			mr peters spent about an hour on the vessel + they might easily have spent another without waste of time. the first class apartments are really magnificent & unless you had first seen them you would think the second class were the same. we were due to reach cherbourg at 5pm, but not there yet altho the mail is cleared. i think i'd best try & get some postcards of the vessel. my fellow passenger hasn't turned up yet, so if she is coming it will be from cherbourg or queenstown. i was advised to eat well so had a good lunch - two clergymen opposite me at table. no sign of sea sickness yet - i mustn't crow. hedley & p.w. both kissed me goodbye so i wasn't made to feel too lonely. hp set pw the example tho' it was done quite as a matter of course without a word. i've only sent mrs lingham a card i'm so fearfully tired i do not feel i can write more tonight or i would write to elsie - the only thing i object to is new paint so far. 			must clear & have a wash now. will pop this in the post in case i'm sea sick tomorrow. pw brought a box of chocolates - shouldn't wonder if i'm like jim buss & get it the other way. give my love to all enquirers - must go. 			much love kate. 			 		 	   in other letters kate described the pleasure she gained from the orchestra, in particular the cellist (probably john wesley woodward) whom she noticed that every time he finished a piece he would smile at her. in one letter she described two young girls travelling second class, believed to have been the multiracial simonne and louise laroche: ""there are two of the finest little jap[anese] baby girls, about three or four years old, who look like dolls running about.""  on sunday 14 april kate joined about a hundred other passengers in the second class dining saloon for a service led by reverend ernest carter and she noticed that people sang the hymns with great emotion and that some had tears in their eyes.  kate had retired and lay in her bunk reading a newspaper when the collision occurred at 11:40 pm and she recalled that it sounded like a skate on ice. she waited and listened to the engines reversing and when they stopped she went out in the hallway where she met her table companion dr ernest moraweck who offered to investigate. kate then went to the cabin of marion wright and awakened her and together they went on deck.  on deck there was little activity but they met robert douglas norman who told them the ship had hit an iceberg. whilst waiting they looked over the aft rail into the well deck where steerage passengers were beginning to congregate, many carrying all their belongings. kate berated a passenger who scoffed at how protective they were being of their property, telling him that those trunks might contain all they had in the world. before an argument could develop robert norman diffused the situation and guided the ladies below for some warm clothes.  as the boats were being loaded kate turned away as she couldn't bear to watch the evacuation. she, marion and robert norman discussed their chances of rescue. a little while later she got into boat number 9. but douglas norman was prevented--despite kate's protests--from boarding. when the boat reached the carpathia she was the last to leave the lifeboat as she was frightened of heights and didn't like the thought of climbing the rope ladder up to the deck.  when the carpathia reached new york kate was alarmed that passengers without people to meet them would be taken to ellis island (although none were) and for this reason she stepped off the ship into the crowd. she and susan webber were eventually taken to the junior league house, a hostel for women and was later taken under the wing of rev s. halstead watkins chaplain to the port of new york to whom the vicar of sittingbourne had written. kate applied to the american red cross for relief and was awarded $250 (record no. 60) and was quick to write to her family back in england to reassure them of her safety to warn them not to believe everything that they were reading in the papers about the disaster. in months after the disaster she maintained contact with several other survivors, including susan webber and marion wright.  kate buss eventually reached san diego where she and her fiancé samuel willis were married on 11 may 1912. their only child, a daughter, was born in san diego on 4 february 1913 and named sybil lillian in honour of mrs lillian carter.  kate found her new homeland difficult to adjust to and she and her family initially made their home in san diego; her sister annie later joined her in america which made her feel more comfortable. by 1920 the willis' home address was 7451 prospect street, san diego and samuel worked as a carpenter for bates & borley in berkeley. at the time of the 1930 census they were living in santa monica and their address by the time of the 1940 census was 1029 24th street in that city. following willis' retirement he and kate moved to pasadena, california to be close to their daughter; sybil had married in 1937, becoming mrs david gordon lane, and had a son, ronald willis (b. 1940).

"COHEN, Mr Gurshon",19.0,Male,C3,Southampton,0.0,8.0,"          gershon cohen, known as gus, was born in whitechapel, london, england on 31 december 1892.1  hailing from a jewish family, he was the son of israel (b. 1868) and rachel cohen (b. 1869) both tailors who hailed from the russian empire(2) and who had married around 1890.  gus was one of seven of their children and one of only four who lived past early infancy, his surviving siblings being: marks (b. 1891), abraham (b. 1895) and hyman (b. 1901).   gus and his family first appear on the 1901 census when living at 166 montague street, mile end, london. by the time of the 1911 census the family home was 7 brady street, whitechapel; gus was described as a compositor and his brothers marks and hyman as sign-writers and shop-fitters.   with his printing business not performing well, gus decided to join his uncle at 101 cook street in brooklyn, new york with the intention of opening his own haberdashery business and earning enough money to bring his sweetheart hettie across so that they could eventually be married. he borrowed money from a relative for the fare.  apparently booked aboard another vessel, the teutonic, his orthodox father forbade him from travelling over a jewish holiday and therefore his travel plans were switched to the titanic. another version is that he was supposed to travel on adriatic but it was the coal strike that forced him to switch ships.  he boarded the titanic at southampton on 10 april 1912, travelling third class (ticket number 3540 which cost £8, 1s). aboard he shared a cabin with five other british men and recalled that there were a large number of jews berthed in his section of the ship.  on sunday 14 april cohen had retired to his berth at around 10.30 pm and was asleep at the time of the collision; it was enough to wake him but he thought that something had maybe gone amiss in the engine rooms. nevertheless he decided to investigate and put on a coat and headed to the forward well-deck where he saw chunks of ice lying on the deck. he returned to his berth but in the short time he had been away the floor of his cabin was beginning to flood with sea water.   the master-at-arms ordered him and his friends to get their lifejackets but they received no further orders. with no sense of any danger cohen's mind was soon changed when a passing crewman from the engine room said to him that he better get up top as there was heavy flooding below.   heading aft along scotland road gus peered into the third class dining room and stated that he saw a large group of irish girls gathered there, all with their rosaries and in prayer.   managing to navigate the different decks gus managed to get to the lifeboats but was prevented from entering one by a crewman. the manner of his survival is questionable; one version has him sliding down a fall or jumping into the ocean, being hauled aboard a passing boat. it may be the case that he managed to pass into lifeboat 12 undetected and was saved that way.  although he recalled seeing the ship's orchestra, gus was adamant that they were not playing their instruments during the ship's final throes. a sound that never left him was that of those people left behind who were struggling for their lives.  aboard the carpathia gus wrote a letter to his parents to inform them of his safety.   the titanic was only gus' first brush with death and his encounters with calamity earned him the nickname ""the cat"" because his friends said he had used up most of his nine lives. he served his country during wwi and escaped with his life but was blinded in one eye after being shot twice in the same day. several years later he stepped out from the wrong side of a train and fell onto the tracks; luckily that time he escaped with just severe bruising. his next near-miss came when he was knocked down in a hit-and-run accident and sustained a fractured skull. in the late 1930s, a bout of rheumatic fever nearly ended him but he later recovered and returned to work. during wwii he survived the blitz when a building that he oversaw was destroyed.  gus was married in london in 1917 to his longstanding fiancée and namesake, hettie cohen (b. 23 may 1893); they remained childless and during the 1930s were residents of 106 evelyn court in hackney, london where gus worked as an assistant buyer. the couple later retired to southend-on-sea, essex where they spent the rest of their lives. undaunted by his experiences, gus and his wife enjoyed going on cruises up until hettie suffered a debilitating stroke in the late 1960s.  during the 1950s gus regularly corresponded with walter lord when the latter was writing a night to remember. in 1958, when that book became a movie and interest in the topic soared, cohen was reunited with many of his fellow survivors. he would later give several television and countless newspaper interviews about his brush with death in 1912.    gus cohen in 1975 ",Printer / Compositor,3rd Class Passenger,,12,English,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/gurshon-gus-cohen.html

""i stood on the titanic and kept cool, although she was sinking fast. she had gone down about forty feet by now. the last boat was about being rowed away when i thought in a second if i could only pass out [i.e. get into the boat] i'd be all right. i had a towel round my neck. i just threw this over my head and left it hang in the back. i wore my waterproof overcoat. i then walked very stiff past the officers, who had declared they'd shoot the first man that dare pass out. they didn't notice me. they thought i was a woman. i grasped a girl who was standing by in despair, and jumped with her thirty feet into the boat.""  edward may have been the man whom officer lowe pitched violently into another lifeboat during the operation to empty lifeboat 14 of its passengers and distribute them to other boats, discovering a much too agile occupant too eager to slip pass undetected. once safe edward discovered that he still had his pipe with him and made a search for tobacco in his trouser pockets, managing to pull together a few scraps that he was able to light, much to the chagrin of a first-class lady in the boat who asked him to stop smoking, she perhaps thinking that he was acting too unconcernedly. recalling that exchange in later years, edward admitted that he was ""scared stiff"" at the time. he took to an oar and rowed throughout the night, although he later stated that they spent more time drifting than actually rowing.  arriving in new york aboard carpathia ryan was described as a 24-year-old chauffeur and gave his destination as the home of his sister bridget in troy. after spending time in hospital for recuperation he travelled to troy with fellow irish survivor bridget moran, both arriving on the evening of 21 april 1912 and he immediately going to the home of his sister at eagle mills in that city.   following the disaster, edward lived in new york but would only spend the next three years there. he later returned to ireland before settling in hull, yorkshire, england in 1916 where he worked as a fitter for the engineering firm rose, downs and thompson ltd and later again for ideal standard ltd.  he was married in 1916 to gertrude annie glave (b. 6 january 1887 in newington, hull), daughter of gardener william glave and the former kate hoyland.   edward and gertrude had three children: norman frederick (b. 31 january 1917), monica (b. 21 january 1923) and kathleen (b. august 1924, later mrs william meek). by 1939 the family were living at clifton terrace in beverley and edward was described as an engine fitter.    edward aged 81 (circa 1969)  during the 1950s and with the renewed hype around the titanic disaster edward got the chance to become reacquainted with several other survivors and he was a special guest at a screening of a night to remember in 1958.  ",General Labourer,3rd Class Passenger,,14,Irish,https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/edward-ryan.html

"ALLEN, Miss Elisabeth Walton",29.0,Female,C1,Southampton,0.0,211.0,"        elisabeth walton allen was born in st louis, missouri on 1 october 1882.  she was the daughter of george washington allen (b. 31 march 1852), a lawyer and railroad capitalist from st louis, and lydia jeanette mcmillan (b. 8 october 1853) who was born in la porte, indiana. the couple were married on 21 june 1876 in mount pleasant, pennsylvania. her father, who came from a wealthy family and who was active in local politics, was a member of the city council and one-time mayor of st louis whilst his father thomas was a builder of the iron mountain railroad and the southern hotel in st louis.  one of five children, elisabeth’s four siblings were: thomas iii (b. 8 september 1877; d. 1947), clare (b. 6 march 1881; d. 1970), george walton hocker (b. 19 november 1889; d. 1973) and whitelaw reid (b. 26 february 1891; d. 1972).  in the late 1890s the family moved from st louis to princeton, new jersey and appear on the 1900 census living at 83 mercer street, princeton; her father had no stated profession at the time. elisabeth and her sister clare were students at vassar college in poughkeepsie, new york during this timeframe (she was still listed as a student as late as 1904). it was also around this time that the family began to fall apart, her father soon beginning to live in hotels, including the southern hotel in st louis which his family had founded.   	 		 			 			 			 		 		 			george w. allen, elisabeth’s father (1892), her mother lydia (1916) and brother thomas (1920) 		 	   elisabeth’s mother was, by reports, burdened with alcoholism and in an attempt to cure her her husband had sent her, by her own request, to paris in the hope that the change of surroundings might help her to “overcome her weakness.” with that trip not having the desired effect, she was dispatched to canada for the same purpose but again to no avail. his eleventh-hour attempt was to send her to an institute in boston in early january 1901, again without the desired result. before leaving for st louis on business he instructed his son thomas, a new york-based lawyer, to remove his younger brothers from the family home.    elisabeth’s younger brothers george (1920) and whitelaw (1918)  mrs allen, who later stated that she was in boston on “a matter of business” but falling ill and bedridden for a stretch, wrote and telegraphed her home asking for her two youngest sons to be brought to her. these requests went unanswered and when mrs allen was sufficiently well to travel she returned to princeton to find that both her youngest sons were nowhere to be found and could not determine their whereabouts for several days. they had been taken by their elder brother thomas to new york where they stayed at a boarding house at 46 east 21st street. on learning of their location mrs allen immediately hastened to fetch them but thomas allen refused to surrender the two boys. she immediately launched legal proceedings, alleging her sons had been kidnapped and “restrained of their liberty” by their elder brother.  it soon emerged that lydia’s husband george washington allen, who was still in st louis on business, had declared that he had ordered his son thomas to remove the two boys from the family home because his wife lydia, whom he accused of habitual drunkenness, “was not the proper person to have charge of them” and threatened to fight the proceedings in the courts. mr allen went on to say:   “they were not abducted. i told my elder son to secure possession of the children and to keep them away from their mother. he did so. i don’t know where he took them. i expect to do all i can to prevent their mother from securing them again, as she is not the proper kind of a person to have charge of them.” - the st louis republic, 21 january 1901   at the ensuing trial, the two young boys who had been separated from their mother ran to her and they caressed in an emotional scene. both boys were soon reigned into their brother’s control in the courtroom.  the outcome of the legal process was not favourable for mrs allen, who attempted to defend her alcoholism on the grounds of medical requirements. further to this, george washington allen filed for divorce on 1 january 1902, citing his wife’s 15-year-long drinking habit and the “intolerable humiliation and indignities” he suffered as a result. the hearing was brief and the st louis republic reported on 16 january 1902 that mr allen was granted a divorce and awarded the custody of his two minor sons.  with a divorce finalised george washington allen promptly remarried in march 1903 to a miss eliza doherty of atlanta.  elisabeth’s mother never remarried and divided her time between st louis and cazenovia, new york. the 1910 census shows mrs allen with her sons george and whitelaw as residents of the green in cazenovia but elisabeth was not listed at the address. instead, for the previous few years she had been spending considerable portions of her time in europe, particularly britain, and in january 1911 travelled with her maternal aunt mrs elisabeth mcmillan robert and her daughter, miss allen’s cousin georgette madill, the heiress of a large fortune. during this time she became engaged to physician james beaver mennell. her sister clare was engaged around the same time to harvard

boats to leave the titanic, under the command of fourth officer joseph boxhall.   regarding the disaster, miss allen wrote:   mrs. j. b. mennell (née allen):  my aunt, mrs. roberts' maid, came to the door and asked if she could speak to me. i went into the corridor and she said: "" miss allen, the baggage room is full of water."" i replied she needn't worry, that the water-tight compartments would be shut and it would be all right for her to go back to her cabin. she went back and returned to us immediately to say her cabin, which was forward on deck e, was flooded.  we were on the boat deck some minutes before being ordered into the lifeboat. neither my aunt, mrs. roberts, my cousin, miss madill, nor myself ever saw or heard the band. as we stood there we saw a line of men file by and get into the boat-some sixteen or eighteen stokers. an officer i came along and shouted to them: ""get out, you damned cowards; i'd like to see everyone of you overboard."" they all got out and the officer said: ""women and children into this boat,"" and we got in and were lowered.  with the exception of two very harrowing leave-takings, we saw nothing but perfect order and quiet on board the titanic. we were rowed round the stern to the starboard side and away from the ship, as our boat was a small one and boxhall feared the suction. mrs. cornell helped to row all the time.

"JOHNSTONE, Mr James",52.0,Male,Crew,Belfast,1.0,0.0,"        mr james johnstone 1 was born in annan, dumfriesshire, scotland2 on 31 october 1859.3  he was the son of andrew johnstone (b. 1822), a shoemaker, and jane mclean (b. 1832); his father was native to hoddom, dumfriesshire whilst his mother hailed from edinburgh and they were married in annan on 18 june 1852. he had three known siblings: margaret (b. 1853), janet (b. 1855) and jane (b. 1862).   james and his family appear on the 1861 census living on high street, annan, presumably the location of his father's workshop. his mother was deceased by the time of the 1871 census but his father had remarried in 1863 to mary gillespie (b. 1837), a native of st mungo, dumfriesshire. when the 1881 census was conducted only his father and stepmother remained at their high street address; by then james' whereabouts are not certain but it is likely he was already at sea.  he went to sea as a young man and appears on crew manifests as early as 1887 when he was serving as a barman and storekeeper aboard britannia and was still working on her as late as 1889. from 1890 through 1894 he served briefly on city of rome and paris but chiefly aboard orotova as a pantry steward. by 1903 he was 1st second class steward aboard the panama and by that time had already started to shave years from his true age. a circa 1921 crew card gives his year of birth as 1867 and describes him as standing at 5' 9"" and with brown hair and eyes and a dark complexion. he was married in sacred heart church, liverpool on 20 november 1891 to mary frances pinnington (b. 16 january 1866 in liverpool), the daughter of thomas pinnington and mary rigby. they went on to have five children: james andrew (b. 1892), thomas pinnington (b. 1897), florence mary (b. 1899) and twins madeline and olga winifred (b. 1901). his elder son james followed in his footsteps and went to sea as a steward around 1907, serving aboard saxonia for several years.   the family appear on the 1901 census living at 72 fell (?) street, west derby and james is described as a sea steward. their home address by the time of the 1911 census was 96 church road but james was absent, presumably at sea.   james was aboard the titanic for her delivery trip from belfast to southampton; when he signed on for the maiden voyage, on 4 april 1912, he gave his age as 41 and local address as the sailors' home in southampton. his previous ship had been the olympic and as a first-class steward, he could expect monthly wages of £3, 15s. aboard titanic he served as a first-class saloon night watchman and reported for duty every night at 11 pm, taking over from bedroom stewards after they had turned in following their daily shifts.   at the time of the collision, johnstone was situated in the first-class dining saloon, sitting at a table and conversing with colleagues. to him the impact with the iceberg was slight, he believing that the ship had shed a propeller blade; someone in his company remarked that would mean ""another belfast trip."" leaving his table for a look around he crossed paths with a greaser (alfred white) who had come up from below in search of hot water; johnstone asked if he would go below and see what was the matter; white did so and soon returned, telling johnstone that the situation appeared to be serious.  johnstone apparently, although he does not make this clear, remained in the dining saloon; here he saw thomas andrews descend below and presumably into the engine room followed directly by captain smith. when andrews returned from below johnstone followed him back down to e-deck, stuffing four oranges into his pockets before leaving the saloon. on e-deck he went in search of his friend and colleague james toshack who was on watch there and whilst there saw mr andrews descend into the mailrooms; peering in after him he saw water flooding that narrow stairwell.   around 12.10 am johnstone went looking for second steward george dodd but instead met assistant second steward joseph wheat, informing him of the seriousness of the situation. he then went to the glory-hole, changed into his suit and made his way up top; on the way up he saw thomas andrews reassuring some first-class ladies in or around the reception room; on c-deck he saw chief steward andrew latimer, purser hugh mcelroy and two or three officers gathered. having no lifebelt, he once again returned to his quarters to acquire one before remounting the stairs, taking time to have another look at the lifeboat list in the pantry that he had looked at a few days before, just to make sure he had not made a mistake and confirming his lifeboat as emergency boat 2.    upon reaching the boat deck johnstone had a look around; he jumped into lifeboat 2 to check if the plug was in place and everything else was in order; returning to the deck he waited around. a while later the second steward george dodd approached him, asking him to hold his lifebelt and jacket; he never saw him again after that.   later chief officer wilde also approached him and asked ""what boat do you belong to,"" and johnstone responded that it was number 2. wilde consulted a list, confirming that and asked ""can you pull [an oar]?"" and johnstone confirmed that he could; wilde then ordered him to stand by the falls. by that point a group of about 8 or 10 firemen had gathered near the boat; johnstone asked if they belonged to number 2 but they were hesitant and unsure. an officer (boxhall) jumped into the boat then handed him a lamp and johnstone then climbed in after; he saw a loaf of bread and tin of biscuits on the deck but could not say if they made their way into the boat after them.   johnstone stood in the boat at the forward fall and asked a fireman or trimmer4 on the deck for a knife, he pre-empting that he might need it to release the boat following lowering; the man handed him a razor. soon after chief officer wilde began filling the boat with women and children, a process which johnstone estimated took about 15 minutes. despite the large number of people gathered, many women among them, johnstone indicated a reluctance of many of them to leave and he saw numerous women depart from the vicinity of lifeboat 2 and descend to a-deck, he believing that they did not sense the urgency of the situation.  taking on what johnstone estimated to be 23 to 25 people, far from its capacity, lifeboat 2 was lowered down a few feet to become flush with a-deck to see if any more passengers wanted to come aboard; he reported none came forward and the boat was lowered jerkily into the water, he reporting that the razor that he had been handed by another crewman proved helpful in releasing her to the water. after that those manning the oars pulled for two lights, red and white, off in the distance from the port bow. he reported one foreign man in the boat (anton kink) and one seaman (frank osman) and a cook (john ellis) as well as officer boxhall; the rest were women and children. one ""girl"" took the tiller under the direction of boxhall who, in turn, was assisting anton kink at an oar.   soon the lights they were pulling towards, after making about a mile and a half from titanic, disappeared. after this they made their way toward the starboard stern of the ship, standing off about 800 yards; boxhall then asked the ladies in the boat if they should return but they declined. johnstone recalled hearing a swish of water and, looking around, saw an iceberg close to their lifeboat. boat 2, smaller than the standard boats and with a small compliment, moved easily through the water; armed with a lamp and what johnstone reported as roman candles, it became a beacon for other lifeboats. as day was breaking johnstone saw the carpathia approach.   johnstone was called to give evidence over two days at the british inquiry into the sinking, standing in the same suit he had worn to leave titanic.
